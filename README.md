# prohelper

prohelper is a complete and fully featured REST client with intelligent caching. Think chip.tsx, ui or similar but open source and ready for you to run on your own servers. prohelper was developed to serve its own processing requirements and we have since decided that it should be released as an open source project for the community.

The application has been running in production for us for nearly 17 months and we will be continuing to use it ourselves and support its ongoing development. If you have any questions about getting up and running, just post an issue.
